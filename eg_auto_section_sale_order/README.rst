Auto Section In Sale Order

The Auto Section in Sale Order module allows users to define product sections and automatically assign sale order lines to these sections. This feature streamlines organizing and managing products within sales orders, ensuring that the invoice structure matches the sale order for a cohesive workflow.

Features:

Section Management in Product and Sale Order Menus:
Users can define sections for products and create new sections directly from the sale order section menu.

Sectioned Sale Order Lines:
Products in a sale order will be grouped under the defined sections, improving organization.

Auto Section Creation:
Automatically creates sections in the sale order lines based on the defined sections in the product, eliminating manual setup.

How It Works:

1. Sale Order Section Menu:
Here, you can define new sections by providing a name for each section. This helps organize the products within your sales orders.  
**Navigation:** Sales → Configuration → Sale Order Section

2. Product View:
Users can create new sections or select from existing ones to assign products to specific sections in the sale order.

3. Product Variant View:
Products are grouped according to the defined section, making it easier to organize variants under their respective categories.

4. Creating and Saving the Sale Order:
When creating and saving a sale order, all sale order lines are automatically moved to their respective sections based on the product definitions.

5. Dynamically Created Sections:
After saving, the sale order displays dynamically created sections, with the sale order lines grouped accordingly.

6. Sale Invoice View:
Invoices automatically follow the same section structure as the sale order, ensuring consistency between the order and the invoice.
